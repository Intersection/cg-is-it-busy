This is a pollster client written in Lua, tested on a WRT54GL (v1.1) running dd-wrt.

~~DEPENDENCIES~~
This client was tested in the following environment:
* Linksys WRT54GL v1.1
* dd-wrt v24 (mini generic build)
* lua version 5.0.2
* wget version 1.11

~~INSTALL~~
1. Install dd-wrt
2. Place router into Wireless Client mode, and connect the router to an access point with Internet access
3. Enable SSH access/administration and enable the JFFS2 partition
4. Run `scp -r . root@<router-IP-address>:'
5. SSH into the router
6. `cd' into 'wtm-router', run `source ./wtm-configure-env.sh' and IGNORE ALL ERRORS FROM `ipkg' (seriously!)

~~UPGRADE~~
When overwriting a prior install of `wtm-router', run the following commands before commencing with the above INSTALL instructions:
    # rm -rf /jffs/usr/*
    # reboot

~~NOTES~~
Because the client's dependencies take up more space than is available in the WRT's nonvolatile memory, it is necessary to install everything but the client itself to RAM. `wtm-configure-env.sh' takes care of this, and will re-install all the dependencies and start the client at each reboot.

The packet sniffer is a custom C program based off of Wi-viz (http://devices.natetrue.com/wiviz/), which can be found in the wiviz-src/ directory.
