Izitbz is a simple web application that communicates whether or not it is "busy" around a router, based on the number of unique MAC addresses in the air.

# How does it work?

1. Every five minutes, a router updates an Amazon SimpleDB domain with the number of unique MAC addresses it counted for that time interval
1. A webapp tells you whether or not it is more or less "busy" than average for that router, based on the count
1. ???
1. Profit!
